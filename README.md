# Uncertainty-Aware Music Genre Classification using Evidential Deep Learning

This repository contains code and instructions to reproduce the results of our study on uncertainty-aware music genre classification using Evidential Deep Learning (EDL). The model is trained on the GTZAN dataset and evaluated with various uncertainty and calibration metrics.

## üìÅ Dataset

- **Name**: GTZAN Genre Collection  
- **Source**: [GTZAN Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andradaolteanu/gtzan-dataset-music-genre-classification)
- **Description**: 1,000 audio files (30 seconds each), across 10 genres:
  `blues`, `classical`, `country`, `disco`, `hiphop`, `jazz`, `metal`, `pop`, `reggae`, `rock`

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

Install required packages (for Colab or local setup):

```bash
pip install librosa tensorflow numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib tqdm

Python ‚â• 3.8

TensorFlow ‚â• 2.18

Libraries: librosa, numpy, scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, tqdm

üß† Methodology Overview
Feature Extraction:
Extract 40 MFCCs per 3-second segment with 50% overlap from each 30s audio file.
Each segment is represented as a 2D input with shape: (130, 40, 1)
Model Architecture:
CNN + LSTM model
Output activation: Softplus to generate Dirichlet parameters
Loss function: Negative Log Likelihood + KL Divergence (Evidential Deep Learning)

Uncertainty Estimation:
Based on Dirichlet distribution: alpha = evidence + 1
Predictive uncertainty = num_classes / sum(alpha)

Calibration:
Temperature scaling is applied to the predicted Dirichlet probabilities to reduce Expected Calibration Error (ECE)

Evaluation Metrics:
Accuracy
Macro F1-score
Confusion Matrix
Expected Calibration Error (ECE)
Reliability Diagram
Selective Prediction (Accuracy vs Coverage)
