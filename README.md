# Uncertainty-Aware Music Genre Classification using Evidential Deep Learning

This repository contains the complete code and experimental setup to reproduce the results presented in our study on **uncertainty-aware music genre classification** using **Evidential Deep Learning (EDL)**. The proposed CNN–LSTM-based evidential framework is evaluated on the **GTZAN dataset**, with a focus on **uncertainty quantification, calibration, and reliability-aware evaluation**.

## 🧱 Model Architecture

A **CNN–LSTM Evidential Neural Network** is employed.

| Layer | Output Shape | Parameters |
|------|--------------|------------|
| Input | (None, 130, 40, 1) | 0 |
| Conv2D (32, 3×3, ReLU) | (None, 130, 40, 32) | 320 |
| MaxPooling2D (2×2) | (None, 65, 20, 32) | 0 |
| Reshape | (None, 65, 640) | 0 |
| LSTM (64 units) | (None, 64) | 180,480 |
| Dropout | (None, 64) | 0 |
| Dense (Softplus, 10) | (None, 10) | 650 |

**Total parameters**: 181,450  
**Trainable parameters**: 181,450  
**Non-trainable parameters**: 0

## 🧮 Evidential Deep Learning Framework

- Output activation: **Softplus**
- Evidence computation:  
  **eₖ = softplus(zₖ)**

- Dirichlet parameters:  
  **αₖ = eₖ + 1**

- Dirichlet concentration:  
  **S = Σₖ αₖ**

- Predictive probability:  
  **p̂ₖ = αₖ / S**

## 🔻 Loss Function
The total training loss is defined as:
L = L_NLL + λ · L_KL
where:
- λ = 1 is the regularization coefficient
- **L_NLL**: Negative Log-Likelihood loss
- **L_KL**: Kullback–Leibler divergence between the predicted Dirichlet distribution and a uniform prior


## 🏋️ Training Configuration

- Optimizer: **Adam**
- Learning rate: **1e−3**
- Batch size: **32**
- Epochs: **40**
- Metric: **Categorical accuracy**

---

## 🔍 Uncertainty Quantification
Uncertainty is computed as:
u = K / S

where:
- **K = 10** (number of genres)
- **S** = Dirichlet concentration

### Reliability Threshold
- **Reliable prediction**: u < 0.4  
- **Unreliable prediction**: u ≥ 0.4

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

- Classification accuracy
- Macro F1-score
- Confusion matrix
- Expected Calibration Error (ECE)
- Reliability diagram
- Selective prediction (Accuracy vs. Coverage)

---

## 📈 Results Summary

| Metric | Value |
|------|------|
| Training Accuracy | 80.64% |
| Validation Accuracy | 72.99% |
| Test Accuracy | 65.81% with song level splitting, 76.06% without song level splitting|
| Test Loss | 1.2574 |
| ECE (before calibration) | 0.1401 |
| ECE (after calibration) | 0.0791 |
| Optimal temperature | 0.6399 |

### 🎯 Selective Prediction

- High-confidence samples achieve near-perfect accuracy
- Accuracy improves as coverage decreases
- Temperature scaling significantly enhances prediction reliability

## 📐 Statistical Validation

- Statistical test: **Wilcoxon signed-rank test**
- Bootstrap iterations: **1000**
- Mean ECE reduction: **0.060845**
- 95% confidence interval: **[0.034680, 0.087250]**
- Test statistic: **0**
- p-value: **3.325859 × 10⁻¹⁶⁵**

## ⚠️ Limitations

- Only MFCC features are used
- GTZAN dataset contains inherent genre ambiguity
- Evaluation is performed in an offline setting
